# 3_Predict-Online-Learning-Completion_202401100300003
This project predicts online course completion using machine learning. It analyzes learner activity data like video views and assignments to train a Random Forest classifier. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to help identify at-risk learners and improve course retention.

This project uses the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works by training each tree on a random subset of the data and using majority voting for classification results. Random Forest is robust, handles both numerical and categorical data well, and performs effectively even with missing or noisy data.

Accuracy: 0.35
Precision: 0.50
Recall: 0.31
